# Tasks Solutions
In this folder you can find all tasks I implemented while learning, these are from Colloquiums(from my and previous years), Laboratories, BIT_Algo and my ideas for problems.
***
Tasks are divided into different folders by category 

( DISCLAIMER: if task solution belongs to two or more categories you will find it in all of them )
***
### Solutions are always placed between lines:
```
#---------------------------
def example():
.
.
.
#---------------------------
```
### Rest of the code are usually driver functions
***

## In ALL_TASKS folder you can find codes from all categories
